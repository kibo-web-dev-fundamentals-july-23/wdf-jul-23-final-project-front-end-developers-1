                        <p class="paragraph">I loved the growing technology since I was 9 years old and I had a dream to read and explore more on the growing technology. My family background made it difficult for me to make my dreams true but Kibo School of Technology came to my rescue. It made it simpler for me persue the course of my dream. As we are speaking I am now steps ahead and I believe that I am meant for greatness and all thanks to Kibo School. It is an institution that really natures dreams and make them possible.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">In my experience at Kibo, I've not only gained valuable technical skills in Python and web development but also honed essential soft skills. One significant lesson I've learned is how to ask for help effectively. I've come to appreciate that seeking assistance when facing challenges or seeking to deepen my understanding is a sign of strength, not weakness. This willingness to collaborate and learn from others has not only accelerated my personal growth but has also fostered a supportive learning environment within the organization.

Additionally, my time at Kibo has provided me with a profound insight into the art of learning itself. I've discovered the importance of prioritizing tasks, setting clear objectives, and staying adaptable in the face of new challenges. These skills have enabled me to manage my time efficiently and make continuous progress in both my technical and personal development journeys. In summary, my experience at Kibo has equipped me not only with technical expertise but also with the invaluable ability to navigate the complexities of learning and problem-solving in a dynamic environment.

                        <p class="paragraph">My first year at KIBO was a year of growth and discovery. I laid the foundation for my future as a game developer by mastering PROG 1 and WDF, using it to create my first game. Challenges were met with determination, and late-night coding sessions were balanced with moments of inspiration.</p>
